# Privacy Policy

**Loaded**

*Last updated: February 10, 2026*

## Introduction

Loaded ("the App") is a personal finance management application that aggregates transaction data from linked financial accounts to provide budgeting, categorization, and spending analysis. The App is operated by an individual developer ("we," "us," or "our") and is not a commercial product. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Financial Account Data

When you connect a financial account through Plaid, Inc. ("Plaid"), we receive the following information:

- Transaction history, including date, amount, merchant name, and category
- Account metadata, such as account name and type (e.g., checking, credit card)

We do **not** collect or store your bank login credentials. Authentication with your financial institution is handled entirely by Plaid.

### Information Provided by You

You may provide additional information through your use of the App, including:

- Custom transaction categories, tags, or notes
- Budget targets and financial goals
- Household member designations (e.g., attributing expenses to a specific person or purpose)

## How We Use Your Information

Your information is used solely for the following purposes:

- Aggregating and displaying transaction data across linked accounts
- Categorizing transactions and reconciling spending against budget targets
- Generating summaries and reports for personal financial planning

We do **not** use your data for advertising, marketing, or any purpose unrelated to the App's core functionality.

## Third-Party Services

### Plaid

The App uses Plaid to connect to your financial institutions. When you link an account, Plaid's own privacy policy governs how Plaid collects, uses, and protects your data. We encourage you to review Plaid's privacy policy at [https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy).

We access only the data necessary to provide the App's functionality, specifically transaction and account information. We do not use Plaid to initiate payments, transfer funds, or perform identity verification.

## Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored locally or on infrastructure controlled solely by the App operator.
- Data is encrypted in transit (TLS/HTTPS) and at rest where supported by the underlying storage system.
- Access to stored data is restricted to the App operator and authorized household members.
- Plaid access tokens are stored securely and are never exposed in client-side code or public repositories.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your financial data with any third party. Your data is used exclusively within the App for the purposes described in this policy.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- Transaction data is retained for as long as it is useful for budgeting and financial analysis.
- You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at the email address below.
- When a linked account is removed, the associated Plaid access token is revoked via the Plaid API, and transaction data associated with that account may be deleted upon request.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access** the personal data we hold about you
- **Request correction** of inaccurate data
- **Request deletion** of your data
- **Disconnect** any linked financial account at any time, either through the App or through [Plaid Portal](https://my.plaid.com/)

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
